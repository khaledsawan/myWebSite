Therefore, given that the future of the country and its reconstruction rests on the studentâ€™s burden, and the future of the student depends on their comfort and continuity, the idea of our project came to help the student to secure suitable housing at an appropriate price to help them complete their study journey in comfort and continuity, by collecting donations and offering discounts on rent prices to the student.',
